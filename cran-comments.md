## Test environments
* local Mac OS X, R 4.4.2
* ubuntu 20.04, R 4.0.2
* local Windows, R 3.4.1

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

## Downstream dependencies
I have installed the package on 3 separate operating
systems (ubuntu, Mac OS X, and Windows) and found no 
issues testing all functions. All tests are blocked 
from CRAN because they require account authentication 
to be run successfully.
